# Presentation Layer

## Purpose
The presentation layer provides materializations for dashboards, tailored for tools like Tableau, Looker, or PowerBI. It is the final layer feeding dashboards and visualization tools.

## Conventions
- Prefix: `dashboard_` for final tailored models.
- Focus on filtering, labeling, and structuring data for direct consumption.

## Example
- `dashboard_financial_executive.sql`: Tailored model for the financial executive dashboard.
