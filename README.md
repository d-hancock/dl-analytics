# CareTend Analytics Data Platform

## Overview

This repository contains the analytics data model for CareTend, providing a structured approach to reporting and analysis. The platform follows a layered architecture, transforming raw OLTP data into business-ready KPIs.

## ðŸ”„ Schema Refactoring Update - April 2025

**Important**: The data model has been refactored to align with the correct CareTend OLTP database schema. This refactoring ensures data accuracy and consistency across all analytics views.

### Key Changes

1. **Corrected Table References**
   - Fixed incorrect schema references (e.g., `OLTP_DB.Prescription.PatientOrder` instead of `OLTP_DB.Encounter.PatientOrder`)
   - Updated table names to match actual OLTP DB structure

2. **Fixed Column Names**
   - Standardized primary keys to use `Id` instead of various `*Key` patterns
   - Updated column names to match documented schema

3. **Rebuilt Join Logic**
   - Corrected relationship patterns between tables
   - Implemented consistent active record filtering

## Architecture

The analytics platform follows a multi-layered approach:

1. **Staging Layer** (`stg_*`) - Direct 1:1 representation of source tables
2. **Intermediate Layer** (`int_*`) - Business logic and dimensional modeling 
3. **Marts Layer** (`finance.*`) - Purpose-built views for specific business domains
4. **Presentation Layer** - Final views for dashboards and reporting

## Core KPIs

The platform supports these key business metrics:

- **Referrals**: Patient referral activity tracking
- **New Starts**: New patient acquisition metrics
- **Discharged Patients**: Patient discharge analytics
- **Drug Revenue**: Revenue from drug-related claims
- **Expected Revenue Per Day**: Revenue forecasting

## Getting Started

To explore the analytics model:

1. Review the refactored data model documentation
2. Explore the layer-specific READMEs for conventions and examples
3. Use the mart views for domain-specific analysis
